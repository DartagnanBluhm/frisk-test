# Frisk-Test ReactJS Frontend

## Setup

The frontend requires the Backend API to be running to function, so ensure that the API is running prior to using the frontend application.

To install all dependencies use `npm install` prior to starting up.

## Startup
Once the API is active the Web Application can be started via `npm start`.
